# Code Breaker (Mastermind)

The Code Breaker game, also known as Mastermind or Master Mind, is a challenging logic and deductive game for two players. One player (the codemaker) sets a secret code of colored pegs, and the other player (the codebreaker) tries to guess it, receiving feedback on their guesses.

The game was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It is based on a paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows. The first computer adaptation was run in the 1960s on Cambridge University’s Titan computer system, where it was called MOO.

In this adaptation of the game, a secret code is randomly generated by the computer using 8 possible colours. The player selects a difficulty level - easy (a 4-pin code) or medium (a 5-pin code). Colours in the code may repeat.
To make a guess, the player selects the colours of the pegs by clicking on the pins in the answer box, cycling through the available options. Once the guess is complete, clicking the check button submits the answer.
Feedback is then shown in the clue box: red pins represent pegs that are the correct colour and in the correct position, while yellow pins indicate correct colours placed in the wrong position. The order of the clue pins does not correspond to specific pegs in the answer.

This website has been created as the second Milestone project for Code Institute's Web Application Development Course.

## User Experience - UX
### User stories

* As a player, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find relevant content.
* As a player, I want this website to be responsive to my device.
* As a player, I want to read the rules of the game to understand how to play and what the objectives are.
* As a player, I would like to set the difficulty level of the game so that I can choose a challenge that suits my skill level.
* As a player, I would like to see feedback on my guesses so that I can improve my strategy and get closer to cracking the code.
* As a player, I want to restart the game quickly so that I can try different strategies without delay.

#### A player (Edge Cases)

* As a player, I want confirmation before restarting a game in progress (will be implemented with the Restart button).

## Design
### Structure
The site consists of a single page where modals are used for displaying rules, setting game difficulty, and providing user feedback messages. The visibility of the main game and the modals is managed by applying and removing a CSS 'hide' class via JavaScript functions linked to button event listeners.

![alt text](docs/image-14.png)

The structure includes a main container with a control container and a game container. The control container features a header with the game's title and three buttons below it that open modal boxes. The modals' and game container`s content is dynamically updated using innerHTML based on the activated event listener. At this stage of development, the "Restart" button is disabled, with its functionality planned for future implementation.

Before the game begins, the game container displays an image of a vault and a message encouraging the player to start the game. Once the game starts, the game container shows a code box, a palette box, and a reasoning box. The code box contains the code, hidden under metal plates until the player guesses it correctly. When the code is cracked, the plates disappear to reveal the code.
The palette box presents 8 coloured pins. The reasoning box comprises an answer box and a clue box. Players clicks on pins in the answer box to form their guess for the code, with each click the colour changes to the next from colour palette. After submitting their guess, feedback is displayed in the clue box. If the guess is incorrect, a new answer box is added below for another attempt.

### Style and design
Considering the character of the game, the goal is to ensure players can focus intently on the gameplay while making the colored pins prominently visible. The overall style of the game interface is industrial and modern, with a rugged and functional design. The concrete-textured background gives it a sturdy and serious feel, appropriate for a logic and deductive game.

### Colour
Shades of grey and metallic tones dominate the layout, creating a cohesive and focused appearance. These colours were picked to create a contrast of bright coloured pins against the muted background and also for the aim of following the industrial style. The yellow lightbulb icon next to the title adds a touch of brightness and symbolism for ideas or solutions.

## Features
### Main container
The main container resembles a device or machine with elements like metal plates, screws, and a vault door, evoking a sense of machinery and a secure facility. The container includes the control container and the game container. The control container’s appearance remains constant throughout the game. The game container, however, displays a message and an image of a locked vault before the game starts, the game board during the game, and an image of an unlocked vault if the player wins.

![alt text](docs/image-15.png)

### Answer box interaction
The palette contains pegs in 8 different colours. In each answer box, clicking a peg cycles through the available colours. Once an answer is submitted, its pegs become disabled. After each incorrect guess, a new answer box appears for another attempt.

### Modals
There are 3 modals used in the site: a modal for setting the difficulty of the game, activated by the "New game" button; a modal with instructions, activated by the "How to play" button; and a modal with a message to the player if they try to submit an incomplete answer code.

### User Testing
Twelve players tested the game. 

Initially, selecting the colour of an answer peg was implemented using drag-and-drop functionality. However, testing revealed that the palette and answer box elements performed inconsistently on mobile devices. As a result, the colour selection method was changed to a click-based system, allowing users to cycle through colours by tapping directly on each peg.

Furthermore, players found it confusing that the clue pin indicating the correct color and position is red, rather than the expected green. This will also be addressed in a future update. Also, the colours of the pink and purple pins, as well as the red and orange pins, need to be more distinct from each other.

Despite the rules stating that clue pins only show quantities, new players still assumed that each clue pin corresponded to a specific position in their guess (e.g., first clue pin showing feedback for the first answer pin). The rules were rewritten to better emphasize this crucial point: clue pins indicate only the total number of correct colors and positions, with no correlation between clue pin placement and answer pin positions.

Users were uncertain how to close the instruction modal, as clicking outside the modal wasn't an intuitive action for many. A dedicated close button was added to improve user experience and make the interface more intuitive.

### HTML, CSS and JS Validation
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator services were used to validate the project's pages for syntax errors.
The screenshots below provide the results of testing.

#### HTML checks
