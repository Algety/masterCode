# Code Breaker (Mastermind)

The Code Breaker game, also known as Mastermind or Master Mind, is a challenging logic and deductive game for two players. One player (the codemaker) sets a secret code of colored pegs, and the other player (the codebreaker) tries to guess it, receiving feedback on their guesses.

The game was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It is based on a paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows. The first computer adaptation was run in the 1960s on Cambridge University’s Titan computer system, where it was called MOO.

In this adaptation of the game, a pin code is randomly generated by the computer using 8 colors. A player can choose a difficulty level - easy (code of 4 pins) and medium (code of 5 pins). The colors of the pins in the code can duplicate. A player drags pins of 8 colors from the palette box to the answer box on the left. After the submit button is clicked, feedback for the attempt (red and yellow pins) is given in the feedback (clue) box on the right. Red pins indicate that a player has guessed a pin of the correct color and in the correct position, while yellow pins indicate a pin of the correct color but in the wrong position. The position of the feedback pins doesn’t indicate which of the pins in the answer box are guessed correctly.

This website has been created as the second Milestone project for Code Institute's Web Application Development Course.

## Site Goals
The goals for this site are:

  
To achieve the goals, the site should meet the following criteria:
- Entice potential customers with captivating visuals and engaging descriptions.
- Build credibility and trust by sharing customer testimonials and endorsements, and providing detailed information about the trip.
- Provide an easy-to-use option for reserving a trip.

## User Experience - UX
### User stories
#### New Visitor
* As a new visitor, I would like to learn more about flights to the Moon to understand if I want to experience this trip.
* As a new visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find relevant content.
* As a new visitor, I would like to know more about the company providing the trips to decide if I can trust them.
* As a new visitor, I would like to read testimonials to understand if these trips are worth trying.
* As a new visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the company for more information.
* As a new visitor, I would like to see pictures from the trips to evaluate what the experience can offer me.
* As a new visitor, I would like to be able to easily reserve a trip.

## Design
### Structure
The site consists of a single page where modals are used for displaying rules, setting game difficulty, and providing user feedback messages. The visibility of the main game and the modals is managed by applying and removing a CSS 'hide' class via JavaScript functions linked to button event listeners.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa95dcb5-9333-486d-921e-448bfd56a866)

The structure includes a main container with a control container and a game container. The control container features a header with the game's title and three buttons below it that open modal boxes. The modals' and game container`s content is dynamically updated using innerHTML based on the activated event listener. At this stage of development, the "Restart" button is disabled, with its functionality planned for future implementation.

Before the game begins, the game container displays an image of a vault and a message encouraging the player to start the game. Once the game starts, the game container shows a code box, a palette box, and a reasoning box. The code box contains the code, hidden under metal plates until the player guesses it correctly. When the code is cracked, the plates disappear to reveal the code.
The palette box presents 8 colored pins. The reasoning box comprises an answer box and a clue box. Players drag pins to the answer box to form their guess for the code. After submitting their guess, feedback is displayed in the clue box. If the guess is incorrect, a new answer box is added below for another attempt.

### Style and design
Considering the character of the game, the goal is to ensure players can focus intently on the gameplay while making the colored pins prominently visible. The overall style of the game interface is industrial and modern, with a rugged and functional design. The concrete-textured background gives it a sturdy and serious feel, appropriate for a logic and deductive game.

### Colour
Shades of grey and metallic tones dominate the layout, creating a cohesive and focused appearance. These colours were picked to create a contrast of bright coloured pins against the muted background and also for the aim of following the industrial style. The yellow lightbulb icon next to the title adds a touch of brightness and symbolism for ideas or solutions.
